# discord-reminder-bot

A simple [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) bot for [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) that sets reminders for individual users, inspired by [slack](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/208423427-Set-a-reminder).
Requires a running MongoDB server to work.

Forked from my other bot for discord, [catbot.](https://github.com/edwin-jones/discord-catbot)
